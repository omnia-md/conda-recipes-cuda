omnia-md/conda-dev-recipes
--------------------------

The development recipes here create conda packages for scientific and numerical software
components associated with the Omnia project. The packages built from these
recipes are shared with the community on [anaconda.org](https://anaconda.org/omnia).

These are development recipes for building packages from the bleeding-edge latest source
versions of selected packages.

Packages are built twice daily by [the Travis CI cron trigger](http://traviscron.pythonanywhere.com/).

To install a development package
```
# Add the omnia and conda-forge
$ conda config --add channels omnia --add channels conda-forge

conda install openmm-dev
```


### Supported versions

Python packages are built against latest two releases of python and python 2.7.
Packages which have a binary dependency on Numpy are built against the latest
two releases of Numpy.

### Building the packages

The recipes here are automatically built using [Appveyor-CI](http://www.appveyor.com/)
and [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/). For linux, we use a modified
[Conda-forge Linux Anvil](https://github.com/conda-forge/docker-images/tree/master/linux-anvil) to ensure that the
packages are fully compatible across multiple linux distributions and versions.

To build a package yourself, run `conda build <package_name>`, or
`./conda-build-all ./*` to build multiple packages across each of the
supported Python/Numpy configurations.
